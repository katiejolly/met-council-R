# Miscellaneous notes

## Where to get help

* Don't underestimate the power of a good Google search

> Include R, a function name/keyword, and avoid terms specific to your data. For example "R ggplot legend title" is likely more effective than "how to change legend titles"

## Speed versus readability

There's a long (and not very productive) history of tension between the tidyverse (packages we have discussed in this document) and other frameworks. One of the most prominent alternatives is `data.table`, and I'm showing my bias by calling it an alternative. 

`data.table` is certainly the faster and more computationally efficient framework, but I think you lose the readability and predictable structure of the tidyverse. There is also far more functionality built off of the tidyverse than data.table. If you ask someone at Metro Transit, they will probably argue that there's with competition to data.table. If you use R for very large data, it may be worth learning data.table at some point.
