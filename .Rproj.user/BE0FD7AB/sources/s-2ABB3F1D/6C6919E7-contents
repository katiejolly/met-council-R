# Modeling

Rather than an introduction to statistics, I want to walk through how to read R model output. We will make an interaction model with the customer type and day of week.

R models generally follow the formula style: `y ~ b0 + b1x1 + ...`. They're create from function just like everything else. The simplest model is the linear model, `lm()`. 

Let's first wrangling the data into the structure we need for modeling. 

```{r}
trips_per_day <- nice_ride_2018 %>%
  group_by(usertype, start_day) %>%
  summarise(trips = n())
```


```{r}
mod <- lm(formula = trips ~ usertype * as.character(start_day), data = trips_per_day)

mod
```
