R has some built-in plotting ability. It’s good to recognize the syntax, but it’s not super common to see “in-the-wild” these days. 7.1 Base R plotting R can make histograms: hist(nice_ride_2018$tripduration) # this one isn&#39;t great because the distribution is so skewed And bar plots: barplot(table(nice_ride_2018$usertype), main = &quot;User Type&quot;) barplot(table(nice_ride_2018$bike_type), main = &quot;Bike Type&quot;) But base R plots are hard to customize and an inconsistent syntax. There’s general agreement that they’re not the best way to plot data in R so we aren’t going to talk much about it. 7.2 ggplot2 ggplot2 is without competiton in the graphics in R world. Not only is it the most popular plotting package, it’s one of the most popular packages, period. It is included in the tidyverse, which we already loaded. ggplot uses the “grammar of graphics” to layer information onto plots. Each plot has the same general structure which makes it easy once you learn the structure. For example, let’s recreate the bar plot of user types from above. We will layer on the information in stages. ggplot(nice_ride_2018) # set up our plotting area ggplot(nice_ride_2018, aes(x = usertype)) # set up our axes ggplot(nice_ride_2018, aes(x = usertype)) + geom_bar() # add the geoms ggplot(nice_ride_2018, aes(x = usertype)) + geom_bar() + labs(title = &quot;User Types&quot;) # add a title "]
