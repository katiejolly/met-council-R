# Reading in Data

I am a strong believer in the [cake-first](https://twitter.com/minebocek/status/1072222447473168389) approach to teaching/learning R. It emphasizes real-world examples, interesting data, and visual feedback. Because of that, I like to use ready-made data packages like `fivethirtyeight` and talk about visualization *before* data cleaning. 

But I also think reading in data is an important skill so we will talk about that briefly at the end of today, but not spend too much time on it. For now, let's eat the cake instead of going out to get the ingredients. That's more fun anyway.

## Data packages

There are a number of packages in R specifically to make data sharing easier. A few examples are:

* `fivethirtyeight` to share to data used in their articles 

* `bikedata` to share data about certain bikeshare systems 

* `ecoengine` to share data from the Berkley natural history museum

We will use the data on diversity in [biopics from FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/straight-outta-compton-is-the-rare-biopic-not-about-white-dudes/). 

### Try it out

In your R markdown, fill in the following code to load your library:

```{r include = FALSE}
library(fivethirtyeight)
```


```{r eval = FALSE}
___(fivethirtyeight)
```

To pull a particular dataset from this package, we can use the `data()` function.

```{r}
data("biopics") # biopics dataset
```

You should now see it in your global working environment.

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/05-env.png")
```


There are also a few different ways to get quick summaries of the data.

First, you can check the dimensions to get the number of rows and columns.

```{r}
dim(biopics)
```

What function would you use to get just the number of columns?

```{r eval = FALSE}
___(biopics)
```

We can also print the first 6 rows of the data with the `head()` function. 

```{r}
head(biopics)
```

How can we modify this code to print the first **10** rows instead?

```{r eval = FALSE}
head(biopics, __ = ___)
```

We can also just get a summary of each variable.

```{r}
summary(biopics)
```

But you'll notice these aren't that meaningful for the character variables. Another way we can extract information about a variable is to use the `$` operator. To just pull out one variable from a dataset, you would write `data$variable`. We can use this syntax to make a table of the countries.

```{r}
table(biopics$country)
```


### Practice

1. How many of the biopics were produced only in Canada? 

2. What is the mean number of subjects in the movies?

3. How many subjects were female?
